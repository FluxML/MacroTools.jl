# Pattern Matching

With pattern matching enables macro writers to deconstruct Julia expressions in a
more declarative way, and without having to know in great detail how syntax is
represented internally. For example, say you have a type definition:

```julia
ex = quote
  struct Foo
    x::Int
    y
  end
end
```

If you know what you're doing, you can pull out the name and fields via:

```julia
julia> if isexpr(ex.args[2], :struct)
         (ex.args[2].args[2], ex.args[2].args[3].args)
       end
(:Foo,{:( # line 3:),:(x::Int),:( # line 4:),:y})
```

But this is hard to write – since you have to deconstruct the `type`
expression by hand – and hard to read, since you can't tell at a glance
what's being achieved. On top of that, there's a bunch of messy stuff to
deal with like pesky `begin` blocks which wrap a single expression, line
numbers, etc. etc.

Enter MacroTools:

```julia
julia> using MacroTools

julia> @capture(ex, struct T_ fields__ end)
true

julia> T, fields
(:Foo, [:(x::Int), :y])
```

Symbols like `T_` underscore are treated as catchalls which match any
expression, and the expression they match is bound to the
(underscore-less) variable, as above.

Because `@capture` doubles as a test as well as extracting values, you can
easily handle unexpected input (try writing this by hand):

```julia
@capture(ex, f_(xs__) where {T_} = body_) ||
  error("expected a function with a single type parameter")
```

Symbols like `f__` (double underscored) are similar, but slurp a sequence of
arguments into an array. For example:

```julia
julia> @capture(:[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], [1, a_, 3, b__, c_])
true

julia> a, b, c
(2,[4,5,6],7)
```

Slurps don't have to be at the end of an expression, but like the
Highlander there can only be one (per expression).

### Matching on expression type

`@capture` can match expressions by their type, which is either the `head` of `Expr`
objects or the `typeof` atomic stuff like `Symbol`s and `Int`s. For example:

```julia
@capture(ex, foo(x_String_string))
```

This will match a call to the `foo` function which has a single argument, which
may either be a `String` object or a `Expr(:string, ...)`
(e.g. `@capture(:(foo("$(a)")), foo(x_String_string))`). Julia string literals
may be parsed into either type of object, so this is a handy way to catch both.

Another common use case is to catch symbol literals, e.g.

```julia
@capture(ex,
  struct T_Symbol
    fields__
  end)
```

which will match e.g. `struct Foo ...` but not `struct Foo{V} ...`

### Unions

`@capture` can also try to match the expression against one pattern or another,
for example:

```julia
@capture(ex, (f_(args__) = body_) | (function f_(args__) body_ end))
```

will match both kinds of function syntax (though it's easier to use
`shortdef` to normalise definitions). You can also do this within
expressions, e.g.

```julia
@capture(ex, (f_(args__) where {T_}) | (f_(args__)) = body_)
```

matches a function definition like `func(a::T) where {T<:Number} = supertype(T)`, with a single type parameter bound to `T` if possible.
If not, `T = nothing`.

## Expression Walking

If you've ever written any more interesting macros, you've probably found
yourself writing recursive functions to work with nested `Expr` trees.
MacroTools' `prewalk` and `postwalk` functions factor out the recursion, making
macro code much more concise and robust.

These expression-walking functions essentially provide a kind of
find-and-replace for expression trees. For example:

```julia
julia> using MacroTools: prewalk, postwalk

julia> postwalk(x -> x isa Integer ? x + 1 : x, :(2+3))
:(3 + 4)
```

In other words, look at each item in the tree; if it's an integer, add one, if not, leave it alone.

We can do more complex things if we combine this with `@capture`. For example, say we want to insert an extra argument into all function calls:

```julia
julia> ex = quote
         x = f(y, g(z))
         return h(x)
       end

julia> postwalk(x -> @capture(x, f_(xs__)) ? :($f(5, $(xs...))) : x, ex)
quote  # REPL[20], line 2:
    x = f(5, y, g(5, z)) # REPL[20], line 3:
    return h(5, x)
end
```

Most of the time, you can use `postwalk` without worrying about it, but we also
provide `prewalk`. The difference is the order in which you see sub-expressions;
`postwalk` sees the leaves of the `Expr` tree first and the whole expression
last, while `prewalk` is the opposite.

```julia
julia> postwalk(x -> @show(x) isa Integer ? x + 1 : x, :(2+3*4));
x = :+
x = 2
x = :*
x = 3
x = 4
x = :(4 * 5)
x = :(3 + 4 * 5)

julia> prewalk(x -> @show(x) isa Integer ? x + 1 : x, :(2+3*4));
x = :(2 + 3 * 4)
x = :+
x = 2
x = :(3 * 4)
x = :*
x = 3
x = 4
```

A significant difference is that `prewalk` will walk into whatever expression
you return.

```julia
julia> postwalk(x -> @show(x) isa Integer ? :(a+b) : x, 2)
x = 2
:(a + b)

julia> prewalk(x -> @show(x) isa Integer ? :(a+b) : x, 2)
x = 2
x = :+
x = :a
x = :b
:(a + b)
```

This makes it somewhat more prone to infinite loops; for example, if we returned
`:(1+b)` instead of `:(a+b)`, `prewalk` would hang trying to expand all of the
`1`s in the expression.

With these tools in hand, a useful general pattern for macros is:

```julia
macro foo(ex)
  postwalk(ex) do x
    @capture(x, some_pattern) || return x
    return new_x
  end
end
```
